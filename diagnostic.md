What is the purpose of a backend?

```bash
The backend stores data and manages communication between the client and server so that more than one user can access a given site at a time and make changes that will
not be able to be seen by other users. Basically, the back end allows for there
to be different states of the same site existing simultaneously.
```

Which layer in the MVC pattern is used by the controller to fetch data?

```bash
Model
```

Which layer in the MVC pattern communicates with the model?

```bash
Controller
```

Why don't we use views in our interpretation of the MVC pattern?

```bash
We have our own front end built up which does not require html generated by the
view layer in order to display the data being received.
```

What does C.R.U.D stand for?

```bash
Create, Read, Update, Delete
```

In which part of the MVC pattern can we find C.R.U.D actions?

```bash
The route tells the controller what action to do, the controller passes it
to the model, the model accesses the data, and then sends it back to the
controller as a response.
```
List at least 5 standard actions that C.R.U.D corresponds to?

```bash
Index, create, show, update, destroy
```

A user action fires a `GET` request for `person/1`. Explain in detail each step
required for data to be returned to the client. (bullet points or ordered list)

```bash
* The route specifies the parameters for the GET request- the :id is 1, the
table contains "person" data. Since there is more than one type of GET request,
the route also knows which type it is. In this case, show.
*The controller for all 'person' data has 'show' defined in it and so it knows to
ask the model to use the specified params to retrieve the data for person with :id 1
*The model gets the data for person 1 and passes it back to the controller in the
specified format.
*The controller passes the formatted data back to the route, which then sends it
back to the client.
```

What is the command to generate a new rails-api app?

```bash
rails-api new ...
```

What is the command to start an instance of a rails server?

```bash

```

What are the commands to drop, create and migrate a database? (3 bullet points)

```bash
*rake db:create
*rake db:drop
*rake db:migrate

```

What is the command to scaffold a pet with a name and an age?

```bash
rails-api g scaffold post name:string age:integer
```

List two advantages of using serializers? (2 bullet points)

```bash
*Serializers make it easy to make changes to your back end and have it implemented
wherever else it is used in your code
*Serializers also make it so that you do not have to write a bunch of
code to specify key value pairs each time you want to add a value
```
